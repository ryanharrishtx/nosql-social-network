# NoSQL: Social Network API
## Description
This is a social network API that was created using NoSQL. The API allows users to create a user, add friends, add thoughts, and add reactions to thoughts. The API also allows users to update and delete users, thoughts, and reactions. The API is built using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

To install this application, clone the repository to your local machine. Once cloned, navigate to the root directory of the application and run the command `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
